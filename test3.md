PowerShell Objects
PowerShell is an object-oriented scripting language. 

﻿

The fundamental concept in PowerShell scripting is the object. A PowerShell object is essentially a data structure. This data structure may be composed of data only, or it may contain code for execution. Executable PowerShell objects are known as functions, cmdlets, or modules, and are described in greater detail later in the lesson. 

﻿

Data Objects
﻿

Classes
﻿

PowerShell objects are built on common schemas known as classes. These classes form the blueprint for the instantiation of the objects. Classes define an object’s properties, which are strictly typed fields of data, and methods, which are actions that may be performed on an object. If a particular object is intended to be instantiated many times in many different sessions, then creating and exporting a class as its blueprint is the appropriate design choice.

﻿

Custom Objects
﻿

While everything in a default instance of PowerShell is composed of objects, for some scripts or tools, it is useful to create custom data structures to store the data for a limited duration. For this purpose, an analyst may create custom objects to store and manipulate data for the life of the script or the terminal session. There are a number of techniques to accomplish custom object creation, but in all versions of PowerShell since 3.0, the PSCustomObject type definition is available. Creating a custom object with that syntax is shown below.

$newObject = [PSCustomObject]@{

    Property1        = $output.property1
    Property2        = $secondoutput.property2

}
﻿

Hash Tables
﻿

This syntax demonstrating the creation of a custom object is also an example of the hash table, which is a key-value pair data structure in PowerShell that is useful for a number of commands, queries, and on-the-fly object creation. In a hash table, each set of two elements is relationally joined so that one, the key, directly points to the other, the value. A hash table in PowerShell is created with the following syntax, which employs three examples of value data types.

$newHashTable = @{ key1 = $value1; key2 = "value2"; key3 = 3}
﻿

If not added during instantiation, keys and values may be added to the hash table in one of the following ways:

$hashTable = @{}

$hashTable.Foo = 'Bar'

$hashTable['Foo'] = 'Bar'

$hashTable.Add('Foo','Bar')

Executable Objects
﻿

Functions
﻿

Functions are prepared selections of code that make execution more modular. By envisioning what may be executed, a savvy analyst may prepare all the operations to be performed on a particular object, leaving only key variables to be retrieved at runtime. Functions are either declared dynamically in a script or called from installed PowerShell modules.

﻿

Functions that are declared dynamically consist of one or more statements that dictate a function’s operation. They are formed by combining the function keyword, a descriptive function name, and one or more valid PowerShell commands inside a set of script block braces. 

﻿

A very simple example function looks like the following:

function Custom-Function {
	Write-Output "Hello World"
}
﻿

A function may be further defined in more advanced ways by adding one or more of the following statements.

﻿

Param Statement

﻿

Parameters are a way of introducing user-supplied data to the function. Each parameter Is listed under the param statement block with the typecast [Parameter()] and a type definition such as string, int32, or a named PowerShell class like FileObject:

[CmdletBinding()]
	param(
		[Parameter()]
		[string]$Variable
	)
﻿

Unless the definition of the parameter includes the keyword Mandatory with the code [Parameter(Mandatory)], all parameters defined in this block are considered optional.

﻿

When the function is called, parameters are filled by inserting data after a hyphenated parameter name, such as the following:

Custom-Function -Variable "DATA"
﻿

Parameter variables are also sent to the function from the pipeline by adding the ValueFromPipeline attribute to the parameter definition:

[CmdletBinding()]
	param(
		[Parameter(Mandatory, ValueFromPipeline)]
		[string]$Variable
	)
﻿

The command below becomes a valid method of passing data to the function. This is a memory-sensitive way of performing execution on a sequence of objects if that is a concern. 

@("DATA1", "DATA2", "DATA3") | Custom-Function
﻿

NOTE: In the above example, only the last item is acted upon, unless a process statement is included in the function, which is described below.

﻿

Dynamicparam Statement

﻿

Dynamic parameters are complicated but powerful parameters available to a function if specific conditions are met. These parameter definitions are useful in certain cases where the function is used on a specific provider drive (such as the Registry) or only when a different optional parameter is used, or when another parameter has a specific value, all cases of which are not known until runtime. 

﻿

The syntax for the dynamicparam statement is below.

dynamicparam {
	If (condition) {
		Code
	}
}
﻿

Begin Statement

﻿

If a function is expected to iterate over multiple objects from a pipeline, there may be some one-time setup operations necessary to begin processing data. In this case, the begin statement defines a block of code performing those operations. If the begin or end statement is used, all three code-based statements (begin, process, and end) must be defined, even if they are empty.

﻿

The syntax is simply the begin keyword before a script block wrapped in braces.

	begin {
		Code
	}
﻿

Process Statement

﻿

The process statement defines which activity of the function is performed on every object received through a pipeline. If no pipeline data is ever received, then this statement is unnecessary. However, if that is a valid use case, then it is used to delineate iterative tasks from setup and cleanup tasks. When referring to the current object in the pipeline, the syntax $_ or $PSItem is used.

﻿

The syntax is simply the process keyword before a script block wrapped in braces.

	process {
		Code -object $_
	}
﻿

End Statement

﻿

If a function is expected to iterate over multiple objects from a pipeline, there may be some one-time cleanup operations at the end of the process. In this case, the end statement defines a block of code performing those operations. If the begin or end statement is used, all three code-based statements (begin, process, and end) must be defined, even if they are empty.

﻿

The syntax is simply the end keyword before a script block wrapped in braces.

	end {
		Code
	}
﻿

Cmdlets
﻿

Cmdlets are a subset of functions in that they are named executable objects, but the key distinction from functions declared from scripts or in a session is that cmdlets come built into the PowerShell framework by default and are written in a different language, such as C#, rather than in PowerShell itself. 

﻿

To list all possible cmdlets in a system, the cmdlet Get-Command is extremely helpful. 

Get-Command -Type Cmdlet

﻿

Modules
﻿

PowerShell module files are denoted with the .psm1 file extension and are loaded into a PowerShell session in the working directory in which the module file is located by using the following command: 

Import-Module <Module-Name>
﻿

In a host analyst’s line of work, it is common to become familiar with and rely on the developments of others who have solved the same problems faced by Windows systems defenders and written modules that contain many functionalities useful for a defender, such as the modules DeepBlueCLI (a Windows Event parsing framework), PowerForensics (a hard drive forensics framework), or Kansa (an incident response framework).

﻿

Properties
﻿

Properties are attributes of a particular PowerShell object. In accordance with the object’s class definition, these properties point to and label data that is relevant to the object. For example, in a PowerShell file object, its properties include the name, size, location, and modification timestamp of the file. Much of this data is actually ported directly from the Windows kernel file object, which is a logical interface to the data on disk. Because the PowerShell framework is written in compatibility with the same framework that forms much of the Windows OS, this access to Windows objects and their translation to PowerShell objects through the underlying framework is common.

﻿

For a given PowerShell object, the various properties, subordinate objects, and methods that may be executed on that object are obtained with the cmdlet Get-Member.

﻿

For example, executing the Get-Member cmdlet on any directory object, such as a user’s Documents folder, returns the following output.

PS C:\Users\trainee> Get-Item ".\Documents\" | Get-Member
﻿

﻿

Figure 11.1-2

﻿

One of the first things to notice is that Get-Member returns the type name of the object, which reveals the class the object is a member of. A number of methods are also returned here, which are pieces of code related to that class and may be executed on objects of that type. 

﻿

Alias
﻿

It is important to note that many PowerShell cmdlets have an alias that may be used to invoke that cmdlet from a terminal session or even within a script. There is a danger in relying on an alias for invoking a cmdlet, however. There is no guarantee that the environment in which the alias is invoked contains that alias or that it points to the intended cmdlet, even if that alias is normally available by default.

﻿

The list of aliases available in a given PowerShell terminal session is retrieved with the command Get-Alias, which is itself aliased with the characters gal.

﻿

﻿

Figure 11.1-3

﻿

Pipelines
﻿

Pipelines ("|") provide the ability to send output from one command into another for further processing. Examples of commands used with pipelines are Get-Member, Format-List, and Select-String. Figure 11.1-4 provides an example of using Select-String with the Get-Content cmdlet to filter the results.

PowerShell Data Gathering Cmdlets
In PowerShell scripts and commands, the following cmdlets are useful for gathering data about particular Windows components or systems. A combination can create a comprehensive picture of a Windows system state.

﻿

Get-Item
﻿

This cmdlet returns the object or list of objects from the specified location. This is used to retrieve a directory, a list of files in a directory, a property of an object, a registry key, or any other object that may be specified by a location in a PowerShell drive.

﻿

Get-Item is used to retrieve a registry key and its subkeys using the following syntax:

Get-Item HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Powershell\1\Shellids\Microsoft.Powershell\
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7625bea0-cda5-497b-a8e6-72397bd64b0f)

Some registry keys of note include the AutoRun keys, which are often used by malicious actors to gain persistence to a machine with each reboot or log in. Those keys are listed below.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServices
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServicesOnce
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunOnce\Setup

Get-Item is also used to retrieve the items in a directory using the following syntax. The wildcard character * specifies all items. 
Get-Item -Path "C:\*"

Get-ItemProperty


This cmdlet is used to return all the properties of an item. On file objects, this cmdlet operates similarly to Get-Item, but on registry objects, the difference is that while Get-Item returns the key and any subkeys, Get-ItemProperty returns the values of the key.
Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\
